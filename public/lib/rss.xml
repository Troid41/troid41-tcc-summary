<br>Auralithe, the Goddess of Light, saw the signs. In her final act before vanishing, she encoded emergency safeguards into the Divine Protocol — constructs, radiant scripts, and memory-bound paths designed to awaken when the gods no longer could.

<br>Kawthar, Goddess of Forge, remained neutral, but not idle. She built the framework that housed the Protocol, forged the world’s foundations, and now her forges and her creations remain. Some silent, some broken, but they all await rekindling by those who remember.

Before the collapse, before the ruin rewrote the skies, there were the Edict-Forgers, and among them the six who shaped the known world:

<br>Selenyx, Goddess of Law, whose word was structure and whose Protocol encoded the very spine of fate. She built the system to endure all challenges, but Selenyx did not foresee that the one closest to her would turn doubt into design…
<br>Luciel, God of Chaos, whose charm masked rebellion. He did not defy the Law with violence but rather with suggestion–whispers into Selenyx’s logic guiding her to allow a singular experiment that would “prove” her law could withstand anything. That experiment was the Crimson Covenant. That allowance was the betrayal.
<br>Auralithe, the Goddess of Light, saw the signs. In her final act before vanishing, she encoded emergency safeguards into the Divine Protocol — constructs, radiant scripts, and memory-bound paths designed to awaken when the gods no longer could.
<br>Elythrae, God of the Soul, defied the Protocol from the beginning. They believe no soul should walk a prewritten path. Elythrae’s rebellion marked them as a traitor or visionary to some, but they left a parting gift, the Veilmark, something that would become key to the world’s resistance.

<br>Selenyx gave order to the observable world with her Divine Protocol, yet Luciel rebelled against it by manipulating her into undoing it.<br>Auralithe foresaw this manipulation and strenghthened this protocol with safeguards, specifically using memories as paths to be followed. It is not explained if they are someone's memories or false memories, but they sound as though they are meant to guide the vessels who will receive such memories.<br>Elythrae however, publicly defied the Protocol from the beginning, creating the Veilmark, which turned out to be the key to the world's resistance.<br>
In this broken age, a hidden failsafe buried deep within the fabric of reality has begun to stir: the Divine Protocol, also known as The Covenant Path. This is not a message written in books or spoken by prophets, rather, it is divine code, encoded into the world itself, a metaphysical system designed to activate only after the gods fell. It doesn’t appear as a voice in your head. Rather, it unfolds through dreams, symbolic visions, and flashes of memory that don’t feel like your own. Those who have been touched by this Protocol, intentionally or by sheer proximity to its activation, are called the Veilmarked. They are not chosen heroes, but survivors, witnesses, and fractured vessels for a plan far older than themselves.
<br>The Divine Protocol has a hidden failsafe designed to become active after the Gods fell.<br>The only thing clear is that it uses living beings as vessels for its plan, giving them memories not of their own in order to lead them to a certain goal. <br>
Becoming Veilmarked is not something you volunteer for. Some were born near divine structures, others were caught in a surge of unstable magic, or simply walked too close to a relic they didn’t understand. The Veilmarked carry sigils or psychic scars, most of which they don’t recognize until certain triggers cause their power to awaken. When two Veilmarked meet, they may feel an uncanny familiarity: voices in their heads sync up, dreams begin to align, and symbols they've seen only in sleep glow faintly on each other’s skin. These connections are not optional; the Divine Protocol was never meant to be walked alone. Certain ancient systems will only respond to multiple Veilmarked working in unison. Some visions are split across minds. Even world-wounds, such as Nether gates or shadow-locked ruins, require cooperative unlocking.
<br>This makes things tricky, especially considering how the Veilmark is described as "The key to the World's resistance", implying it is a direct resistance against the Divine Protocol. Yet, it is <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://discord.com/channels/1363165126018207754/1363621350853447740/1395028301424099392" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link" href="https://discord.com/channels/1363165126018207754/1363621350853447740/1395028301424099392" target="_blank">exactly what makes the protocol work</a>?<br>To better try to understand this we need to separate what was Elythare's work and what wasn't.<br>The veilmark was made by Elythrae yes. But the false memories are the work of Auralithe:<br>
"memory-bound paths"
<br>Meaning the memories they have are originally meant to favour the Protocol's wish.<br>Auralithe may also be responsible for the glowing sigils in peoples' bodies:<br>
" radiant scripts"<br>
On her description.<br>
"symbols they've seen only in sleep glow faintly on each other’s skin"<br>
While describing the effects of the Veilmark.
<br>So Elythrae rebelled in somewhere else, how can he help the Protocol by creating the Veilmark, something necessary for the Protocol to function, yet rebel against it at the same time?<br>"certain triggers cause their power to awaken"<br>He gave them power. He gave the vessels something more than just a prewritten path, but the power to do more. What power they possess is not yet confirmed, but it allows them to defy the Protocol, it is this world's last resistance.<br><br>The Divine Protocol is the embodiment of order, set paths all major things in the known universe should follow. <br>Two of the Edict-Forgers rebelled against it, whilst another one created a failsafe in the case of their rebellion working.<br>Yet, one of the rebels created The Veilmark something that would be the key to this failsafe, whether it was their intent or not.<br>The Veilmark is dubbed "The key to the world’s resistance", which could mean many things, those being:<br><br>
<br>
The protocol is harmful to the world in the long run.

<br>e.g.: It includes the destruction of the world in the case of the Gods being gone.<br>
By this example I think it doesn't necessarily mean the Protocol is evil in nature or against the interests of the World, since it could also be a case of mercy, as if putting down a sick animal so it does not live in pain.


<br>
The Protocol is the World's last hope, this would be the reverse of the last guess.

<br>This would imply that Elythrae does not wish for the total destruction of the Protocol, but to change it. They made the Veilmark to help keep the Protocol in place for the most part, whilst also trying to give the people free will.

<br>Going even deeper into this theory I would go as far as to guess that originally The Divine Protocol intended for its "vessels" to be unaware that they are being influenced or used, they were supposed to follow blindly, quite literally like constructs following their protocol and nothing else. But Elythrae frees their soul, reminds them of their free will by letting them be aware of the differences.




<br>
And much more, honestly due to how many variables we have in the end there could even be a possibility that the Veilmark is not supposed to be an act of rebellion but genuinely to restore the Protocol and bring back the Edicts. Who knows maybe he wants to rebel but do it "the right way", and have it be agreed upon with everyone? xD

<br><br><br>Roughly a century ago, the divine order collapsed. Gods vanished, realms fractured, and the laws of life, death, and memory began to break. What remains is a world caught between ruin and resistance. The land is scarred: overgrown ruins lie in once-bustling villages, ancient divine machinery flickers in and out of function, and the Witherwood spreads like infection, erasing the memories of any who linger too long near their rotting branches. The sky in some regions twists with aurora veils, while in others, divine forges or temples hover broken in the air, remnants of a world that once had purpose and structure.<br>In this broken age, a hidden failsafe buried deep within the fabric of reality has begun to stir: the Divine Protocol, also known as The Covenant Path. This is not a message written in books or spoken by prophets, rather, it is divine code, encoded into the world itself, a metaphysical system designed to activate only after the gods fell. It doesn’t appear as a voice in your head. Rather, it unfolds through dreams, symbolic visions, and flashes of memory that don’t feel like your own. Those who have been touched by this Protocol, intentionally or by sheer proximity to its activation, are called the Veilmarked. They are not chosen heroes, but survivors, witnesses, and fractured vessels for a plan far older than themselves.<br>Becoming Veilmarked is not something you volunteer for. Some were born near divine structures, others were caught in a surge of unstable magic, or simply walked too close to a relic they didn’t understand. The Veilmarked carry sigils or psychic scars, most of which they don’t recognize until certain triggers cause their power to awaken. When two Veilmarked meet, they may feel an uncanny familiarity: voices in their heads sync up, dreams begin to align, and symbols they've seen only in sleep glow faintly on each other’s skin. These connections are not optional; the Divine Protocol was never meant to be walked alone. Certain ancient systems will only respond to multiple Veilmarked working in unison. Some visions are split across minds. Even world-wounds, such as Nether gates or shadow-locked ruins, require cooperative unlocking.<br>A major consequence of the Sundering was the breakdown of death itself. Most beings without the Mark of Mortality now fall and awaken endlessly, often degraded or warped, caught in loops the world can no longer resolve cleanly. The Mark of Mortality restores consequence; it locks death into permanence. Veilmarked with this mark walk a harder path, but also one of greater importance, because they alone can truly alter the world’s state.<br>The Witherwood, one of the most dangerous post-Sundering zones, plays a central role in memory erosion. Not everyone has lost their memories, but many did, especially those who traveled through or awoke near Witherwood incursions. For those affected, even their names, families, and pasts might feel fragmented or lost. Your character can decide how much they remember. You might have only a name, a face in a dream, or a single relic from before. You may believe you remember everything, only to learn those memories were rewritten or distorted.<br>Though the story begins in a quaint village settled by the Witherwood, that is not all the world has to offer. It is merely the start to what the protocol needs for you to understand the world around you. For only once you are deemed ready, you are sent to explore what the divine has left for you to uncover.<br>The Sundering itself occurred approximately 70 to 100 years ago, recent enough that elders may still speak of it, but long enough that most of the current generation was born in its aftermath. The Divine Protocol has only recently begun to reactivate. Whatever force initiated it, whether divine spark or divine desperation, it has now started to pull the Veilmarked together. And once one fragment awakens, others follow. You are part of the world’s last unfinished sentence.<br><br>Before the collapse, before the ruin rewrote the skies, there were the Edict-Forgers, and among them the six who shaped the known world:<br>
<br>Selenyx, Goddess of Law, whose word was structure and whose Protocol encoded the very spine of fate. She built the system to endure all challenges, but Selenyx did not foresee that the one closest to her would turn doubt into design…
<br>Luciel, God of Chaos, whose charm masked rebellion. He did not defy the Law with violence but rather with suggestion–whispers into Selenyx’s logic guiding her to allow a singular experiment that would “prove” her law could withstand anything. That experiment was the Crimson Covenant. That allowance was the betrayal.
<br>Auralithe, the Goddess of Light, saw the signs. In her final act before vanishing, she encoded emergency safeguards into the Divine Protocol — constructs, radiant scripts, and memory-bound paths designed to awaken when the gods no longer could.
<br>Elythrae, God of the Soul, defied the Protocol from the beginning. They believe no soul should walk a prewritten path. Elythrae’s rebellion marked them as a traitor or visionary to some, but they left a parting gift, the Veilmark, something that would become key to the world’s resistance.
<br>Kawthar, Goddess of Forge, remained neutral, but not idle. She built the framework that housed the Protocol, forged the world’s foundations, and now her forges and her creations remain. Some silent, some broken, but they all await rekindling by those who remember.
<br>Veyxar, God of Shadow, a deity that had no name until the world granted it one. Veyxar was never meant to be, and yet it now watches, listens, and feeds. It was not born out of divine intent, but rather divine failure. It is echo, regret, hunger, and possibility

<br><br><br><br>(A voice echoes across the realms — fractured, ancient, and reverent. It is neither god nor mortal, but something caught in between…)<br>
“Hear this, Veilmarked. The silence is broken. The Protocol awakens.
Long have the realms drifted, severed from the Edict-Forgers' breath, rotting beneath the weight of forgotten law. But within you stirs the flicker — the Mark — that which even death could not bind.
You stand now at the edge of all things. The world remembers your name not, but the Covenant does.
Rise, Echo-Bearers. The Witherwood whispers. The Divine Forgeries rumble. And the Path winds forward through ash and revelation.
This is no blessing. This is the burden of remembrance.
Welcome to The Crimson Covenant. The Sundering broke the world. You… must decide what becomes of it.”
<br>With this haunting invocation, the realms stirred, and the Veilmarked awoke.<br><br>Players found themselves within a mysterious holding chamber — cold, echoing, and humming with divine residue. Without warning, the ground trembled beneath their feet.<br>
“The ground trembles… a deep rumble rises from below, as if the world might collapse.”
<br>The floor gave way, plunging them into the open sea. In the dark waters, violet light shimmered ahead. A message appeared:<br>
“Swim now. Follow the glowing Chosen — they will guide the way. Seek the village that cradles the Witherwood tree.”
<br><br>Drawn to safety by a strange glow, the players emerged on a shoreline beneath a gray sky, where a group of Veilmarked — perhaps chosen earlier, perhaps simply more aware — took the lead. They gathered, rallied, and ventured through the dense forest toward the village where the Witherwood awaited.<br>Upon arrival, the newcomers found a small camp nestled at the village’s edge. Fires were lit. Stories shared. Names exchanged. Tents claimed. It was here, among whispers of something vast and ancient, that the Veilmarked began to piece together fragments of their purpose.<br><br>Though answers were scarce, the locals offered guidance — particularly Jorin and Coleen, two figures with an unsettling awareness of the Protocol’s movements. They provided basic tools and ensured the newcomers could defend themselves and gather what they needed to survive.<br>Yet beneath every tool handed over and every answer given, more questions stirred:<br>
<br>Why did the Divine Protocol choose them?
<br>What is the Mark’s purpose?
<br>Who are the Chosen… and who were left behind?
<br>Is this fate… or something far more sinister?
<br>The Covenant has only just begun to unfold. The realms remain fractured, the gods absent, and the truth buried deep beneath the soil and soul alike.<br><br>The coming days promise deeper truths — and greater trials. The Veilmarked have taken their first steps, but the Path is long, and the world waits, silent and watching.<br>
"Rise, Echo-Bearers... the burden of remembrance has found you."
<br><br><br><br><br>It began with whispers...<br>
A diseased cow found at the edge of the Witherwood - skinned. <br>The villagers chose silence. But the Veilmarked remembered.<br>
And the Divine Protocol stirred, whispering:<br>
"Observation error. Memory thread reactivation initiated."
<br>Urged by instinct, the Veilmarked were pulled back to the old campfire, where their journey began. There, reflection turned to tension. Smoke drifted unseen. Something was out there. Watching. Waiting.<br>
"Proceed with caution. The timeline may already be tainted."
<br><br>The air was still, but uneasy.<br>
The Protocol whispered, faint and uncertain, as Veilmarked returned to the campfire - the place where it all began.<br>
“The Divine Protocol stirs… a buried flame calls to you.”<br>
“Your thoughts drift to the old campfire…”
<br>And with it came back the memories.<br>
“You remember the cow they found in the woods. Not dead. Not alive. Just… skinned.”<br>
“Its body stripped clean, as if peeled by something that had done it before.”
There were too many footsteps that day. Too close. And yet... no one went further.
“You told yourself it wasn't your concern.”<br>
“You were wrong.”
<br>The Veilmarked began to question. Tensions rose. The Protocol sharpened.<br>
“Observation Error: Site left unchecked”<br>
“Memory Thread Reactivation: Skinned entity | Traces of presence”<br>
→ RECOMMENDED ACTION: Return to the site. Examine the trail. Follow the silence.
<br>Then... they smelled it. Smoke - but no fire. No warmth. Just something waiting in the clearing.<br>
“Trace particles detected: Char | Ash | Residual Heat”
<br>And then, as the players rallied -<br><br>
“The Divine Protocol reinitializes.”<br>
“Phase Sequence: STAGE ONE – Journey to the Woods”<br>
"Smell recognized: Smoke – human-made origin likely"<br>
→ NEW DIRECTIVE: Follow the source of the smoke.
<br>The Veilmarked set out into the forest.<br>
There, within the blackened glade, they uncovered a burnt child’s hat? <br>
“We were just cold… he said we’d feel warm soon…”
<br>Their voices lingered, even as the players gathered their remains.<br>
The whispers gave way to a form.<br><br>
“He said the fire would take the sickness… but the sickness stayed… now it’s in me.”
<br>A partially-burnt child emerged from the smoke, animated by something far from peace.<br>The Protocol gave its grim order:<br>
“Unburden the child… Grant it peace.”
<br>Defeated, the child fell, but not alone. From the soot and grief came a wail that split the trees.<br><br>
“No… no… my baby…”<br>
“You let the fire take him, Tomas… and now it burns me.”
<br>The Ashen Mother appeared, twisted by loss, consumed by rage.<br>
Her voice cracked the world.<br>
“I will not rest. Not until the world feels what I felt.”
<br>
“Protocol Directive: Purge the burning sorrow. Let grief turn to ash.”
<br>The players struck her down, but what lingered behind was not closure. It was dread. The Mother fell, not with peace - but fury.<br>
The woods were silent again… but far from safe.<br><br>Returned to the village, the players turned to Tomas’ shop, now locked tight and suspiciously abandoned.<br>
“The door is barred… it hasn’t been opened in days.”
<br>Inside: crates hastily packed. One crate, left ajar, begged investigation. Within it? A journal containing the truth he tried to bury...<br><br>
“The flame of truth has been kindled. Shadows linger beneath the surface.”<br>
“Easy Mode unlocked: Hunger enabled. Hostile mobs now spawn in the wilds. Stay vigilant.”
<br>The Protocol, once steady, now hesitates.<br>
Luciel’s voice - chaos incarnate - has slipped through.<br>The timeline is no longer safe.<br>Though unease lingers, the Veilmarked return to routine.<br>
But the question now looms: How long will this quiet last?<br><br><br><br><br><br>It began in silence…<br>
Not a whisper this time, but a breath held too long by the world itself.<br>The villagers spoke of hammering in the dark, sparks striking against nothing — and by morning, the earth had also seemingly grown a spine of stone:<br>A library where none had been... A tower that should not exist...<br><br>The air shifted. Elder Thorne’s voice — once brittle and scattered — sharpened like flint struck against stone.<br>
“There’s been an odd convergence… northeast of the tavern.”<br>
“Necromancers. Restless dead. Gathering where they shouldn’t.”
<br>He didn’t shout. He didn’t need to.<br>
The forest itself seemed to lean in.<br>
“Something with power enough to call them stirs in the woods.”<br>
“If you value peace — or your life — investigate.”
<br>## A Mind Awakens<br>
The wind stopped.<br>Something deeper than silence stretched through the forest — a pause too still to be natural.<br>A hush falls over the woods. Even the wind holds its breath.<br>Then, a blade of light carved down from above —<br>
silver and searing, cutting clean through canopy and shadow alike.<br>The world held its breath as something spoke.<br>
A voice, ancient and distant, echoes from everywhere and nowhere.<br>
“Eirwen… awaken.”
<br><br>The forest shifted.<br>What once felt like underbrush became something older — watching.<br>The forest thickened. Branches clawed at you whilst shadows lengthen unnaturally.<br>
Mist gathered at one's feet, swirling with whispers only some seem to hear.<br>Suddenly, the trees parted — revealing a tower of spiraling stone, jutting from the earth…<br>
Its form echoes the shrine west of the village — but this is no shrine.<br>The Protocol thrummed. Recognition?<br>
No — anticipation.<br><br>A bell tolled from nowhere.<br>
Once. Clear. Too distant, yet near — like a memory resurfacing.<br>Something here remembers you.<br>
Even if you do not remember it.<br><br>The towering structure looms before you, its doors sealed tight like the vault of a forgotten god.<br>A voice resonates from beyond the black veil — soft, distorted, and cold.<br>
“You arrive as the Protocol foretold…” the voice intones. “I am Elarion…”<br>
The words vibrate through the forest air, as if spoken directly into your mind.
<br>Your thoughts tangle with whispers: fragmented words of past visitors, their fates uncertain.<br>
“Enter,” the voice whispers again, softer now. “Let the Tower judge your worth.”
<br><br>Elarion’s eyes glint as he hands you a battered tome: the Brewing Journal.<br>
“Three brews mark your initiation,” he intones, voice echoing oddly within the Tower’s walls. “Mundane. Thick. Awkward. Each tests a brewer’s heart — and each reveals a truth.”
He leans forward, robes shifting like liquid shadow. 
“These are not mere potions. They are the first step in binding your will to the Tower’s memory.”
<br>A low hum pulses through the floor beneath your feet, as if the Tower itself listens.<br>
“Do not falter,” Elarion murmurs, voice like distant thunder. “Every drop you brew writes itself into the Tower’s memory.”
<br><br>As the last potion cools, the Tower’s walls resonate with a low, musical hum.<br>A ripple of light climbs the tower’s inner walls, each floor above flickering briefly to life.<br>A low chime rings in your mind as arcane symbols bloom and fade across the floor beneath you.<br>
Elarion nods slowly, his smile curling at the edges. “You have done well… the Tower acknowledges you.”
<br><br>The Divine Protocol thrums low within your chest.<br>Recommendation: Remain vigilant. The Tower has many more floors — and many truths to uncover.<br>The Tower’s walls quiet, but the air still hums with a promise — and a warning.<br>]]></description><link>source-channels\main-channels\recaps.html</link><guid isPermaLink="false">Source Channels/Main Channels/Recaps.md</guid><pubDate>Wed, 16 Jul 2025 15:36:17 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Enderman Analysis]]></title><description><![CDATA[

"It ties into the overall lore of the sundering in a way but that’s for you all to find out why/how"<br>
At first glance, Endermen are wrong. Slender, tall, alien in movement — but beneath the surface? Familiar. Too familiar.
Their skeletal framework mirrors human proportions: two arms, two legs, upright spine, central cranial cavity. Cartilage and tendons in the limbs are nearly identical to human equivalents, if anything they are simply elongated.
Muscle fibers are… variable. They shift density when observed, almost like they recalculate themselves based on who’s looking. I blinked and found the heart had moved. When I looked again, it was gone?
Some tissue samples even registered faint signs of human DNA — corrupted, yes, but present. This shouldn’t be possible. Not unless…
…they were based on us. Or we were based on them.
The eyes are the most resistant part. Removing them intact is near impossible — they rupture, but never leak. Instead, they fracture like glass, splintering light in all directions. When exposed to the Mortality Shrine. The reaction was immediate:
Light bent unnaturally.
You saw reflections of yourself, but aged… changed… possibly dead?
And you heard a sound. A low, repeating whisper:<br>
“Not yet. Not yet. Not yet.”
The structure of the eye is crystalline. No retina. No iris. Inside: refracted dimensional residue — layers of memory, possibly locations the Enderman has seen… or fled.
These eyes are not for seeing this world.<br>
They are for peering between it.

Think late medieval early renaissance but with the heavy divine influence so with my numera reference it’s a world that has seen the rise and collapse of several civilizations the divine left remnants of their pre-sundering golden age’s experiments hence certain things seeming very fragmented to our current world (tech and age)
Essentially like TCC would read as “A world stuck in a fragmented late medieval age haunted by relics / glimpses into an impossible future dreamt by the gods” — basically yes weird things but that’s just due to the silly tinkering and research of the gods with their free time 
In reference to medicine which is what you want think again late medieval early renaissance understanding of anatomy but it’s expanded on by divine memory so it would read as “pre-scientific medical touched by divine biological abnormality” — so medicine would be like again 1400s-1500s ish where surgery is crude think the transition from barber surgeons, understanding of anatomy is very renaissance with Vesalius era diagrams, tools like scalpels and stuff okay but not as high tech as current so things like the saw, needles, sutures, scalpel and along those lines okay, disease theory would be more so humoral theory/miasma/spirtual, healing magic (though not mentioned atm) is non standard though can and will be seen in tcc
However with medical tech not being advanced I would allow for a player to write up something that bridges missing knowledge bcuz divine knowledge can certainly bridge any gaps. Perhaps combinations of traditional med and spiritual/ritualistic/etc can yield results not previously thought to be possible or certain revelations can be made by certain people

 <br><br>Once having been human, Beastkin are believed to be the result of an ancient divine curse, or a failed blessing, depending on who you ask. Their animalistic traits range widely, from subtle physical hints to full body transformation. Their blood remembers things that their minds do not. Not two Beastkin are the same. Some are born with slitted eyes or fur-tufted ears. In rare cases, a Beastkin is touched by something older, causing them to twist into a myth-born form, bearing traits of serpents who once guarded gates, or giant birds whose cries shook mountains. Their curse has no fixed form, only legacy. Some seek to purge the beast within, hunting for god-forged relics that can cleanse their line, while others seek the origin of the pact, desperate to restore their kind to what they once were or perhaps ascend into something more. <br><br>
<br>Varied Species: Beastkin can appear as any animal, even mythical creatures- some being more rare than others.
<br>Fully Changed, Shifter, Traits: Beastkin range in type as well as Species. From more beast-like and animalistic, to simple ears and tails.
<br>Differing Lifespan: anywhere from the simple 70-ish years of a human, to hundreds of years. It depends on the species.

 <br><br>Caretakers of the old god forges, not divine themselves but molded by proximity. When the Sundering came, the forges collapsed, but the dwarves endured, adapting to the silence of gods with rituals of fire and steel. Many now search for the Last Ember, the spark needed to reignite creation. The dwarves are some of the only races still whispering the names of the gods. They hold onto fragments of old edicts. While some seek to rekindle the divine forges, to awaken the flames that once shaped the realms themselves, others believe it is time to forge new edicts, carving a path with their laws.<br>Known for their deep maze-like cities, set both in and spiraling under mountains. Mining and metalwork are their most known traits, being the race with the most intricate forging. Even past the well-known metalwork, craftsmanship is important to Dwarves, anything from jewelry to wood and leather working.<br>Their communities are tight-knit, though they welcome anyone willing to pull their own weight. <br><br>
<br>Build: Stocky, with strength to carry out difficult tasks.
<br>Long-living: Much like Elves, Dwarves live for a long time. 300 years seems to be the point where they start to degrade. 
<br>Craftsmanship: Crafts are important to dwarves, with economy built off trade or time rather than monetary value.

 <br><br>Once part of the world’s raw essence, until the gods gave those elements names. Naming awakened them. Now they are beings of living matter struggling to maintain a shape in a world that tries to define them. Many long to return to a nameless state, while others wish to become divine themselves All elementals are driven by a singular core instinct or directive, preservation, destruction, guarding, wandering, etc.<br><br>
<br>Composed of surrounding materials: Most elementals reflect the materials of their environment: fire, water, stone, ash, mist, plants, sand, etc.
<br>Unstable form: Their bodies may shift, flicker, crack, drip, or grow depending on mood, damage, or magical influence.
<br>Rarely age: Elementals don’t decay in the traditional way, but may erode, fade, or change if neglected or forgotten.

 <br><br>A fractured legacy, stemming from a single divine origin. In ages past, they were the chosen scribes, the first to interpret the edicts carved by the gods. When the Crimson Covenant shattered the Veil and silenced the divine, the Elves did not perish. They splintered. <br>The High Elves believe themselves to be the descendants of the divine will, living in echoes of the gods' favor. They believe that the Messengers were tools, not kin, as they were mere instruments lacking the souls Elves claim to possess. <br><br>
<br>Build: Most High Elves are tall and lean, built for distant spells and bows rather than close combat.
<br>Hair: Ranging from white, to silver, to bright blondes. Their hair is important to them, longer hair being a sign of a calm peaceful elf. Braids are a sign of family and importance.
<br>Long-living: Elves live for a long time. 300 years seems to be the point where they start to degrade. 
<br>Wood elves turned away from the sacrilege of the high elves and chose to speak with the land rather than the sky. They revere no god, but speak of the first grove, a place that remembers the true names of the world. <br><br>
<br>Build: Average in height, Wood Elves near the build of humans the most, if not slightly leaner. 
<br>Hair: Much like the High Elves, hair matters a lot to the Wood elves. Ranging in more earthy dark tones, they take pride in the camouflage their hair can provide. Often braided in groups with intricate styles.
<br>Long-living: Elves live for a long time. 300 years seems to be the point where they start to degrade. 
<br>Drow are elves who were either cursed or cast down. Some claim to remember the gods’ last words, others claim to have heard someone or something else whisper in the deep, promising freedom.<br><br>
<br>Changed: Drow change the most compared to their counterparts, their skin often becoming tones of grey, with undertones of more vibrant colors depending on the region. Their eyes become a stark bright point, glowing faintly no-matter the color.
<br>Disgraced: Some Drow embrace the changes, cutting their hair shorter, where others opt to keep it as long as they can. No matter what they pick, it is practicality over anything.
<br>Long-living: Elves live for a long time. 300 years seems to be the point where they start to degrade.

 <br><br>Fae, insectoid beings born not of divine design, but from the loopholes in the Divine Protocol — fragments of the gods’ will warped by forgotten oaths, abandoned contracts, and failed blessings. As manifestations of divine fine print, Fae feed on intent, consent, and the binding of words. Their entire existence revolves around contracts, pacts, and bargains– not as tools of manipulation, but as sacred expressions of identity and power. Each Fae is anchored by a personal pact: a vow that defines who they are and governs their personhood. To break such a vow is to unravel part of oneself.<br>Though eerie in appearance– marked by chitinous skin, faceted eyes, and gossamer wings– most Fae hold profound respect for free will. They never force a deal, only offer one… and their word once given is iron clad. Across the fractured realms, they are known as negotiators, illusionists, and paradoxically loyal allies, so long as the terms are clear. <br>To some, Faw are the most trustworthy folk left in a world unmoored from divine order. To others they are walking gambles — beautiful, unnerving reminders that even laws still have teeth. <br><br>
<br>Insectoid: Slender-framed with segmented chitin-like skin. Usually black, emerald, amethyst, or copper-hued
<br>Wings: Moth or beetle-like wings that fold seamlessly behind them, allowing brief gliding or bursts of vertical movement.
<br>Neutral Tricksters: They adore cleverness, satire, and wordplay. However, they consider lies vulgar; twisting the truth is far more elegant.

 <br><br>Neither forged nor carved, rather spoken into existence. A race of potential rather than purpose. Born after the First Edicts, they lack divine constraints and are dangerously mutable. This lack of divine intention made them perfect vessels for Covenant experiments, becoming both the heroes and horrors of the modern world. Despite their short lifespans, as a whole humans will do anything to make their mark on history, on the world. Their greatest strength is their ability to adapt to any situation with the resilience to pull through. Though they lack strong connection to any one thing, it’s made up by their ease of bridging the gaps between the other races, natural mediators. <br><br>
<br>Resilience: A human can live through many hardships, mental and physical.
<br>Short life span: Most humans only live to around eighty years, with a constant decline in their physical and mental health in most cases.
<br>Varied appearance: Multitudes of hair, eye and skin colors.

 <br><br>Long before The Sundering, before the Crimson Covenant tore the Veil and silenced the gods, the Messengers were not born, but forged, having their souls bound by the First Edicts—divine laws etched into the world’s very bones when the gods sculpted the realms into order. Though rumored to be the mouthpieces of the gods, they were mere tools, half-living constructs given just enough soul to obey and adapt.<br>Messengers are the creations of the gods, made in their own image– for better or worse. Mortals of the overworld have the belief that Messengers are links between Mortal and God, they are incorrect in this assumption; In reality, they have no communication to the Gods, isolated to their respective realms with the illusion of “safety.” The portals to their homes are dull and abandoned, falling apart at the seams, sealing the one path left to the overworld with nothing but a shell of what once thrummed with magic. Now the Messengers share stories and experiences between the generations, warnings and stories weaved together. Messengers were once vessels of the gods will, now wandering– living, thriving– as puppets missing their strings. The Messengers have evolved over the years, changed, losing what had once linked them to their creators slowly.<br>It is believed that once, the End and Nether Messengers worked hand in hand, before The Sundering, before they lost their connection to the gods, to the other dimensions.<br>End messengers were never meant to live long. They were created to observe, remember, and vanish. In the frigid, starry void they originated, they evolved to hide from those who sought them, both predators and fellow watchers alike. After the Sundering, they became more like ghosts, flocks bound by blood and movement, migrating through forgotten knowledge. They speak in fragments, mimicking the gods’ silence more than their voice. They are believed to be the last voices of the silent gods. Some seek to speak for the divine once more, while others rebuke divinity as they were left to fade away.<br><br>
<br>Winged: Wings covered in thick feathers, long and broad to glide from island to island. Their wings have an additional claw at the wrist joint, made for scaling chorus fruit trees or structures to kick start their journey– to make up for the lack of wind currents in the void of the End, they rely on endurance more than speed, oftentimes going for days without stopping.
<br>Build: Spindly and smaller by default, experts of silent flight and stealth evolved from generations of avoiding the other creatures of the realm. Running takes priority before a fight.
<br>Nether Messengers, born as enforcers, shields, and flames for hire. They protected ancient vaults and walked molten bridges between mortal and divine. After the Veil shattered, they forged clans, led tribes, and proudly remained wrathful protectors of ruins long forgotten. To them, survival and legacy are sacred, and every scar is proudly displayed. Some wish to set fire to the forges once more, others wish revenge upon the Covenant that shattered them.<br><br>Winged: Leathery wings covered in thick skin or scales, much like that of a bat. They range from short to medium in length and broad– depending on their home biome– taking advantage of warm air columns to stay in flight for longer durations of time. Their wings have an additional claw at the wrist joint, made for scaling various warped and twisted trees to aid in takeoff.<br>
Wings range from short and broad– for quick bursts of speed and maneuverability, though lacking in overall prolonged speed– mid-length, angular and narrow– experts in sustained speed, though lacking in the same level of agility.
<br>
<br>Build: Stocky and large by default, their wings support larger sizes with ease in comparison to their End counterparts. Fighting takes priority over fleeing, prideful and strong enough to support it.

 <br><br>The first vampires were never meant to exist. In the wake of the Sundering, as the gods fell silent and the Veil quaked, a resurrection ritual was cast in defiance of death. Yet no god answered - instead, the soul was ripped back, unanchored, and returned to the body without the laws that once bound it. These first creations were more magic than mortal. They were unstable, volatile, and driven by violent instinct. The magic infused within them outpaced their bodies’ ability to contain it, resulting in near-constant ruptures of flesh and mind. They were marked by horrific outbursts of strength and hunger, often devouring entire villages before collapsing under their arcane weight. Many of these first-generation vampires did not last long. Those that did are monstrous legends, hunted or worshiped in the deep shadows.<br>
Each vampire bloodline descends from one of these originals, their power thinned with every generation. The further from the source, the less volatile the magic becomes - instincts are dulled, hungers more manageable, and strengths diminished. Still, the oldest bloodlines carry echoes of the original curse.<br>There is a rumor of a hidden ritual circle deep in the mountains where the first vampire is still alive, barely hanging on, with dreams of ascending.<br><br>
<br>Near-immortality: Vampires are already considered undead, leaving them resistant to most things– including aging. 
<br>Growth: Even the oldest vampires sometimes struggle with the latent magic they possess. It must be trained and nurtured to learn to do anything with that magic.
<br>Varied Race: Due to the watering down of their bloodline, some vampires have distinct looks from other races, rather than the looks of a generation one vampire.
<br>Distinct looks: Nearly all vampires have bright glowing eyes, ranging from purple, yellow, red, or pink. Other colors are rare, but not unheard of. However, all vampires have a distinctly undead look to them, appearing most often as an undead pallor to their skin.

 <br><br><br>Jorin’s voice echoed through the village hours before dawn, ranting about shadows moving where no torchlight reached. He swore the mine was alive, whispering his name with each pickaxe swing. When the first rays of morning broke the horizon, the ground itself shuddered, and then came the roar.<br>A thunderous collapse swallowed the lower tunnels, sending plumes of dust spiraling from the mine’s mouth.

 <br><br><br>In a night when the stars burned cold and silent, Elder Thorne stirred. For weeks he’d shuffled through the village, bent and muttering half-sentences, eyes clouded by age, or so all believed. But beneath the surface, something watched. Waited. Remembered.<br>As dusk fell, hammering echoed from the heart of the village. Sparks flashed in the dark. By dawn, where there had been nothing but an overgrown clearing, a towering library stood, doors carved with symbols older than memory. The scent of fresh-cut timber hung thick in the air, and Elder Thorne stood tall at the entrance, eyes sharp as obsidian.<br>He declared the Library open, voice clear and commanding:<br>
“The world has forgotten itself. Go. Seek what was lost. Bring me the words carried on the winds of ruin, the truths hidden in shadows. This Library hungers for the knowledge you find.”
<br>No one dared question how the frail old man had raised a monument overnight. Whispers spread: that Elder Thorne was more than he seemed, that the gods had lent him a fleeting spark, or that something far older had awoken in his bones.<br>Now, as you approach the great doors, Elder Thorne adjusts his heavy robes, eyes glinting with the weight of centuries.<br>
“Ah, you arrive in a time of shifting winds. Tell me, child… what brings you to these halls of brittle truths?”
<br><img alt="Screenshot_2025-06-30_at_7.30.25_PM.webp" src="lib\media\screenshot_2025-06-30_at_7.30.25_pm.webp"><br><br>Beneath the grand library’s towering arches, Elder Thorne has set up his humble stand: a worn table with thick questbooks resting at either side, each inscribed with the dark ink of prophecy. From here, Elder Thorne alone offers  quests, tasks meant to unravel the mysteries of the Veil and guide those marked by its unseen hand.<br>The quests Elder Thorne offers vary and change with time, shifting like shadows at dusk. For now, he extends simpler tasks designed not only to serve the village’s needs but to gauge the strength and resolve of the Veilmarked, those touched by fate who've wandered into his care.<br>Nearby, two well-used notice boards stand tall, their surfaces crowded with parchment pinned by villagers and travelers. These postings, unlike Elder Thorne’s carefully chosen quests, invite anyone to offer or accept small jobs, favors, or calls for help keeping the village alive with trade, cooperation, and tales of shared adventure. (Just click em with a signed book)<br>As dawn breaks and the village stirs, Elder Thorne’s lanterns burn bright beneath the library’s watchful spires, a beacon for those ready to prove themselves or... fall short.]]></description><link>source-channels\storylines\the-library-of-echoes.html</link><guid isPermaLink="false">Source Channels/Storylines/The Library of Echoes.md</guid><pubDate>Wed, 16 Jul 2025 10:05:03 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="lib\media\screenshot_2025-06-30_at_7.30.25_pm.webp" length="0" type="image/webp"/><content:encoded>&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;lib\media\screenshot_2025-06-30_at_7.30.25_pm.webp&quot;&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[README]]></title><description><![CDATA[

Troid's TCC Summary is my best attempt at not only making the lore more compact and easy to follow with graphs but also at theorizing about it!
If you have more information about any of this, please do contact me on Discord (@Troid41)! By more information I mean old messages that one would have a harder time finding, like older questions on the <a href=".?query=tag:Questions" class="tag" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">#Questions</a> channel I might have missed to avoid people asking the same things over and over, or just small information reveals dropped in some character's channels/during RP :D
This entire thing was just made so I can keep my sanity while working at shop that has some very slow days xD
If I ever drop this and stop updating it, I can drop the Obsidian vault file on the discord and teach you how to convert it into a website as well so others can keep it up. Or maybe you can just copy this and make your own version! ^^

Hello Veilmarked ;)
This website was made to store up all the important lore information I could find for ease of understanding and theorizing! It also serves as a repository of every little message or lore reveal that isn't included on <a data-href="Recaps" href="source-channels\main-channels\recaps.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Recaps</a> or <a data-href="Lore" href="source-channels\main-channels\lore.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Lore</a>...But that nonetheless is still important!
